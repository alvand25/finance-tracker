# Receipt OCR System Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview

The system will follow a modular, plugin-based architecture consisting of:

1. **Core Components:**
   - Store Classifier: Identifies the store from receipt images

   - Handler Registry: Manages and loads store-specific handlers

2. **Handler Interface:**
   - Base Handler: Defines the interface for all store-specific handlers
   - Store-specific Handlers: Implement custom extraction logic for each store
   - Generic Handler: Fallback for unrecognized stores
