# Receipt OCR System Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview

The system will follow a modular, plugin-based architecture consisting of:

1. **Core Components:**
   - Store Classifier: Identifies the store from receipt images
   - Image Preprocessor: Enhances images for better OCR results
   - Receipt Processor: Coordinates the overall processing workflow
   - Handler Registry: Manages and loads store-specific handlers

2. **Handler Interface:**
   - Base Handler: Defines the interface for all store-specific handlers
   - Store-specific Handlers: Implement custom extraction logic for each store
   - Generic Handler: Fallback for unrecognized stores

3. **Supporting Data:**
   - Known Stores Database: Maps store names to their canonical forms
   - Configuration Settings: Controls processing behavior

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework
1. Create base handler interface
2. Develop handler registry for dynamic loading
3. Create store classifier module
4. Implement image preprocessor
5. Create initial known_stores.json
6. Create core receipt processor

### Phase 2: Vendor-Specific Handlers
1. Implement generic fallback handler
2. Extract store-specific handlers from existing code:
   - Key Food handler
   - Costco handler
   - Trader Joe's handler
   - Walmart handler
   - Other priority stores

### Phase 3: Core Processor Refactoring
1. Update receipt_service.py to use the new architecture
2. Refine receipt processor with improved error handling
3. Implement metadata enrichment for processed receipts
4. Add receipt validation and confidence scoring

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. Enhance test runner to validate modular components
2. Create test cases for each handler
3. Implement error analysis and reporting tool
4. Set up automated test pipeline

### Phase 5: CLI Enhancement
1. Update CLI interface to utilize new architecture
2. Add handler selection and debugging options
3. Improve command-line feedback and reporting
4. Update documentation with new architecture details

## Technical Decisions

1. **Handler Discovery:**
   - Handlers will be discovered dynamically at runtime
   - Will use a plugin-based approach to support extensibility

2. **Store Classification:**
   - Multi-stage approach:
     a. Text-based matching with known store names
     b. Logo detection for visual confirmation
     c. Layout analysis for template matching

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Progressive degradation approach
   - Confidence scoring for extracted data
   - Multiple extraction attempts with different strategies

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Caching of intermediate results
   - Lazy loading of handlers
   - Progressive processing pipeline

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 2 weeks
- Phase 5: 1 week

## Success Metrics
- Increased accuracy in vendor classification (>90%)
- Improved item extraction rate (>85%)
- Reduced error rates on unseen receipts
- Faster processing time for known vendors
- Cleaner codebase with better maintainability scores
